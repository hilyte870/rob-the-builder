# 🛠️ Rob The Builder Alpha

Build apps, games, and web tools instantly through AI-powered blueprints.

## 🚀 Vision
Infinity Builder is a mobile-first AI engine designed to bridge the gap between idea and execution. Users describe a product, and the engine generates a structured, deterministic **Blueprint JSON** which can be edited and previewed in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Vite + React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 💎 Features
- **Prompt interpretation**: Natural language to structured JSON.
- **Stateless Rendering**: Instant mobile-preview without build steps.
- **Precision Editor**: Tightly controlled UI cards for project refinement.
